XMOS USB Device Design Guide
============================

This document details the use of the XMOS USB Device (XUD) Library
(see :ref:`xmos_usb_device_library`) to create USB 2.0 devices on
the XMOS xCORE architecture.

This document a worked example that uses the XUD library; a USB Human

code for the example can be downloaded from the XMOS website.

This document assumes familiarity with the XUD Library, XMOS xCORE
architecture, the Universal Serial Bus 2.0 Specification (and
